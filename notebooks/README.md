# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains exploratory analysis for the group project dataset.

The purpose of this EDA is to better understand the structure and behavior
of the data before building predictive models. This includes identifying
patterns, checking data quality, and exploring relationships between key
variables.

## Files

- `Group_Project_EDA.ipynb`  
  This notebook explores:
  - The overall structure of the dataset  
  - Missing values and data quality issues  
  - Basic summary statistics  
  - Time-series behavior of sensor variables  
  - Initial visualizations to identify trends and anomalies  

## Notes

- This notebook is **exploratory**, not part of the final modeling pipeline.
- Code and visuals here were used to inform later feature engineering
  and model selection decisions.
- Results may change as the dataset is cleaned or refined.
